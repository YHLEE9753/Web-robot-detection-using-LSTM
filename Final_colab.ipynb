The first is request uri and the second is prediction through time differences between logs. Human pattern analysis was performed through these two, and as a result of prediction through the generated model, it was found that the accuracy exceeded 90%. Through this, it can be seen that web robots and humans show distinctly different pattern differences in log approaches, and these patterns can be learned and predicted. By using this approach, web robots that access specific sites can be sufficiently prevented. This is expected to prevent bad bots trying to achieve personal benefits through data within the company, and to be a sufficient solution for companies with traffic problems or data problems by web robots.<br>"],"metadata":{"id":"kf39XxSpYe7x"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1iNxstlgmSFS"},"source":["##- Reference\n","\n","[1] Web Robot survey https://ppcprotect.com/blog/ad-fraud/how-many-of-the-internets-users-are-robots/ <br>\n","[2] Lagopoulos, Athanasios and Tsoumakas, Grigorios.
